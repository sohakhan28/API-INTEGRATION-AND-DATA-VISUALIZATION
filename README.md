# API-INTEGRATION-AND-DATA-VISUALIZATION
This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization using Python. A sample weather dataset (mock_weather_data.csv) containing datetime, temperature, humidity, and wind speed values was used to simulate weather forecasting data. The project was developed in Google Colab with the help of Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
